## 💻 About

Next Level Week Heat is the 8th edition of this event offered by [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br) to the community.
In this edition, on the Impulse track, a complete and accessible widget was developed that can be used in multiple projects to collect feedback
of users.

The application's backend was built with NodeJS, something recurrent in the NLW challenges, using the best testing practices and with an incredible tool to deal with the database that is Prisma.
In the frontend, ReactJS was used and as a builder we used the Vite tool that dealt with all the bureaucratic part and allowed us to move forward in a
surprising. On the frontend we still use TailwindCSS, which makes it easier to style and make our app look elegant quickly and easily, and its syntax is very similar to the one used in Bootstrap.

As for the mobile part, it was built with React Native and Expo, the application made it possible, consuming the backend, to provide feedback through the cell phone with a
incredible performance and using good formatting practices, layouts, color variables and fonts.

The impulse track classes were taught by [Diego Fernandes](https://github.com/diego3g) and [Rodrigo](https://github.com/rodrigorgtic). 🚀

## 🚀 How it works

This project is divided into two parts:
1. Backend (server folder) 
2. Frontend (web folder)

💡 The Frontend needs the Backend to be running to work.

### Pre-requisites
Before you begin, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine: [Git] (https://git-scm.com), [Node.js] (https://nodejs.org/en/). In addition, it is good to have an editor to work with the code like [VSCode] (https://code.visualstudio.com/)

#### 🎲 Running the Server (Backend)

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone git@github.com:exodogurgel/feedget.git

# Access the project folder in your terminal
$ cd server

# Install the dependencies
$ npm install

# Run the application in development mode
$ npm run dev

# The Server will start at port: 3333 - go to http://localhost:3333
```
---

#### 🧭 Running the web application (Frontend)

```bash
# Access the project folder in your terminal
$ cd web

# Install the dependencies
$ npm install

# Run the application in development mode
$ npm run dev

# The application will open on the port: 3000 - go to http://localhost:3000
```
